### Hey there!

My name is David Moyer! My pronouns are they/them, but he/him are fine! I am a Software Developer with experience in C#, Web Design languages, and Java; As well as limited experience in SQL, C++, and Python.

I am a hard working developer with an interest in game design, primarily developing with Unity with a bit of Godot and Unreal Engine 5 knowledge. However, I pride myself on quickly adapting and learning to whatever languages or applications are necessary!
An avid problem solver who can work independently or with a team, I'm a good asset for any team.

If you'd like to reach out to me professionally, you can contact me at moyer_ds@hotmail.com!
